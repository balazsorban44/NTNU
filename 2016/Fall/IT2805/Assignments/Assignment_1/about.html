      <h2>This is me</h2><img src="http://balazsorban.com/images/me-bw.jpg" alt="a picture of me">
      <p>I taught myself web programming sicne 2015 September. I feel that I understand the basics, and have a lot of knowledge, but I feel it is a bit poorly organised in my head. I love using preprocessor languages, like  <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">PUG</a> (formerly Jade), <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> to make my code nicer and easily legible. I like experimenting with new features and try new stuff.</p>
      <p>I hope that with the help of the course I can better organise and broaden the knowledge I have got from self-learning.</p>
      <p>I also hope that I will get a better understanding of how big networks are built, so it could make a good foundation for my future, where I idealise myself as a webprogrammer, or a researcher of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The server stores the necessary files for the webpage, and runs the server-sided (backend) tasks, like database managing, and other scripts.</li>
        <li>The client recieves the files from the server, and then renders it to the user's screen, usually in a graphical web browser.</li>
        <li>An IP address is a unique identifier for every single device which is connected to the internet. The devices on the Internet find each other with the help of this Internet Protocoll.</li>
        <li>The DNS, or Domain Name System is a system, which matches the IP addresses - which are hard to remember for humans - with a more recognisable (domain) name, like  <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a></li>
        <li>The Internet is the largest network on Earth, connecting billions of devices (IoT - Internet of Things) together, while WWW or W3 - which stands for World Wide Web - is the set of standards/rules for websites supervised by <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. If one considering to make a website, it should follow the W3C guidelines.</li>
        <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is a markup language. It is often called the "skeleton of the website", because it is where the content is. HTML can serve as a website per se, while CSS and JavaScript cannot. They only give aesthetics and interaction to the page.</li>
