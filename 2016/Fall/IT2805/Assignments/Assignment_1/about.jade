      p I taught myself web programming sicne 2015 September. I feel that I understand the basics, and have a lot of knowledge, but I feel it is a bit poorly organised in my head. I love using preprocessor languages, like  
        a(href='http://jade-lang.com/') PUG
      (formerly Jade), 
        a(href='http://sass-lang.com/') SASS
      and 
        a(href='http://coffeescript.org/') CoffeeScript</a> to make my code nicer and easily legible. I like experimenting with new features and try new stuff.
      p I hope that with the help of the course I can better organise and broaden the knowledge I have got from self-learning.
      p I also hope that I will get a better understanding of how big networks are built, so it could make a good foundation for my future, where I idealise myself as a webprogrammer, or a researcher of Artificial Intelligence.

        li The server stores the necessary files for the webpage, and runs the server-sided (backend) tasks, like database managing, and other scripts.
        li The client recieves the files from the server, and then renders it to the user's screen, usually in a graphical web browser.
        li An IP address is a unique identifier for every single device which is connected to the internet. The devices on the Internet find each other with the help of this Internet Protocoll.
        li The DNS, or Domain Name System is a system, which matches the IP addresses - which are hard to remember for humans - with a more recognisable (domain) name, like  
          a(href='www.google.com') www.google.com
        li The Internet is the largest network on Earth, connecting billions of devices (IoT - Internet of Things) together, while WWW or W3 - which stands for World Wide Web - is the set of standards/rules for websites supervised by 
          a(href='https://www.w3.org/') W3C</a>. If one considering to make a website, it should follow the W3C guidelines.
        li HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is a markup language. It is often called the "skeleton of the website", because it is where the content is. HTML can serve as a website per se, while CSS and JavaScript cannot. They only give aesthetics and interaction to the page.
